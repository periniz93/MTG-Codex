Notes
Every draw engine doubles as blink fodder, so Teleportation Circle and Lae'zel's
Acrobatics churn through the deck. Restoration of Eiganjo and Serra Paragon
recycle fetchlands and utility creatures, while Touch the Spirit Realm answers
problematic permanents or becomes a flashy blink trick via channel.
