About
Name Dimir Conquest Catalogue
An attrition strategy that mills itself, stockpiles fodder, and converts piles

Notes
Cheap self-mill engines flood the graveyard so Conquest and Cruelty can rebuy
whatever mix of threats and toolbox creatures the moment demands. Saiba Syphoner
doubles as disruption and a redraw, while Skyclave Shade gives a repeatable
sacrifice body to feed Conquest's five-permanent clause.
