About
Name Izzet Phoenix Foundry
Classic Arclight Phoenix pressure gains a token subtheme thanks to Iconoclast
and Pyromancer, letting the deck pivot between flying recursive threats and go-
wide prowess bursts.

Deck
4 Arclight Phoenix
4 Third Path Iconoclast
4 Young Pyromancer
4 Consider
4 Opt

Notes
Token-makers ensure Lightning Axe and Pieces of the Puzzle have plenty of fuel,
while Fable filters Phoenix copies into the graveyard. Iconoclast turns every
cheap spell into pressure, forcing opponents to answer both recursive fliers and
an army of artifacts.
