About
Name Orzhov Parhelion Pilgrimage
Greasefang pilots Parhelion II, but the deck leans on white recursion like
Extraction Specialist to replay its namesake pilot in grindy games.

Deck
4 Greasefang, Okiba Boss
4 Raffine's Informant
4 Scrapwork Mutt
4 Parhelion II
4 Skysovereign, Consul Flagship
4 Reckoner Bankbuster
4 Duress
4 Go for the Throat
4 Extraction Specialist
4 Shattered Sanctum
4 Concealed Courtyard
4 Caves of Koilos
2 Takenuma, Abandoned Mire
2 Eiganjo, Seat of the Empire
4 Plains
4 Swamp

Notes
Scrapwork Mutt and Raffine's Informant ensure Parhelion and Skysovereign reach
the graveyard, while Extraction Specialist and Takenuma replay Greasefang
through removal. Reckoner Bankbuster doubles as discard fodder and a card
advantage engine to keep hands stocked.
