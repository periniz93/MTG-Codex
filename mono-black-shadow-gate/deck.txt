About
Name Mono-Black Shadow Gate
Shadow-Rite Priest threatens to cheat gigantic demons into play, turning
disposable one-drops into surprise finishers supported by heavy black
disruption.

Deck
4 Shadow-Rite Priest
4 Cult Conscript

Notes
Priest tutors up Archfiend or Angel of Suffering for sudden lethal swings, while
The Cruelty of Gix doubles as removal and a reanimation spell. Graveyard
Trespasser keeps opposing graveyards in check so Archfiend's upkeep clause
remains manageable.
