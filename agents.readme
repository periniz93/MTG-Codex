# MTG Codex Deck Creation Guidelines

These instructions are for anyone generating decks for this repository. Follow them for every new deck submission.

## Color Identity
- Build each deck with one, two, or three colors, with a strong preference for single- or two-color lists.
- Feel free to explore unorthodox or surprising color pairings when it serves the deck's theme or mechanics.

## Synergy & Theme
- Ensure the cards in every list play off one another—combo pieces, shared archetype payoffs, or mutually reinforcing game plans are all encouraged.
- Decks may be driven by:
  - **Themes** (e.g., tribal identities, storylines, worldbuilding).
  - **Mechanics** (e.g., specific keyword interactions or resource loops).
  - **Aesthetics** (e.g., art style, flavor text cohesion).
- Balance creativity with playability; decks should be coherent and purposeful.

## Repository Structure
- Create a dedicated folder for each deck at the repository root (e.g., `./<deck-name>/`).
- Inside each deck folder, include:
  - A `.txt` file containing the Arena-exportable decklist plus a short explanation of the deck's motivations, synergies, and key interactions.
  - Any supplemental notes or assets relevant to the deck (optional).

## Decklist Format
- Use the provided `template.txt` file as a reference for formatting Arena-ready deck exports.
- Maintain the `About`/`Deck` section headers so the list can be copied directly into MTG Arena.
- Ensure card counts and names exactly match official card titles recognized by Arena.

## Review Checklist
Before committing a new deck, verify that:
1. The deck stays within the 1–3 color guideline (preferably 1–2 colors).
2. Cards demonstrate clear synergy or a unifying theme/mechanic/aesthetic.
3. The deck lives in its own folder with an explanatory `.txt` file.
4. The Arena decklist format matches the template.
5. Motivation and strategic notes accompany the list in the same `.txt` file.
